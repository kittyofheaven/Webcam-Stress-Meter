# Webcam Stress Meter

## Inspiration
While surfing around google and youtube I found this interesting article about [Photoplethysmogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram). It tells us that traditional oxy/heart rate monitor use cameras to measure changes in light absorption (**corresponding to an absorption peak by (oxy-) hemoglobin**) that can be converted to a heart rate. So I think why not use a webcam? While it looks very impossible but it's possible by setting the webcam for high iso sensitivity and capturing a color fluctuation on our skin.  

And secondly, there is an article where it states that our heart rate is related to the stress we experience [Effects of stress on heart rate complexityâ€”A comparison between short-term and chronic stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653595/). So after a bit of brainstorming, I decided to build Webcam Stress Meter.  


## What it does
It calculates your heart rate only using your webcam and combines it using the face emotions model resulting in a **calculation for the stress meter**.

## How we built it
To build the webcam heart rate monitor I use cv2 to capture, and distribute webcam data, some filters, and to track our faces. Then a numpy gives some calculation to the tensor so that the app can measure the light change in our skin and extract it into a heart rate.

For the face emotions model, I use this kaggle data and train it using google colab with TensorFlow. then import it to the script using TensorFlow again and with help of cv2, the app can predict a real-time webcam stream.

Then I combine this two to calculate the stress level of the users using a basic math & numpy.
