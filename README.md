# Webcam Stress Meter
## Inspiration
While surfing around google and youtube I found this interesting article about [Photoplethysmogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram). Basicly it tells us that traditional oxy/heart rate monitor use camera to measures changes in light absorption (**corresponding to an absorption peak by (oxy-) hemoglobin**) that can be converted to a heart rate. So i think why not using a webcam? While it looks like very imposible but its actually possible by setting the webcam for high iso sensitivity and capture a color fluctuation on our skin.

And secondly there is an article where it states that our heart rate is related to the stress we experience [Effects of stress on heart rate complexityâ€”A comparison between short-term and chronic stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653595/). So after a bit of brainstorming, I decided to build Webcam Stress Meter.  


## What it does
It calculate your heart rate only using your webcam and combine it using face emotions model resulting in a calculation for stress meter.
